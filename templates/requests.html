Requests
--------
We are happy to try to process jobs of interest to other scholars. Please append the archive.org text identifier to our public [request spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArJt01185Q8mdERsS2VRMngtTWRNUDAtNGFxZXhFQVE#gid=0). Note that at present we are unlikely to get good results from black-and-white ('binarized') page images, or from the low-ish resolution of text that derive from Google Books.
