Editing
-------
We have also developed an editing enviroment to ease the process of hand-correcting these results. If you have a team of students or researchers who would like to edit one or more of the texts in this collection, please contact us.
  
Requests
--------
We are happy to try to process jobs of interest to other scholars. Please append the archive.org text identifier to our public [request spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArJt01185Q8mdERsS2VRMngtTWRNUDAtNGFxZXhFQVE#gid=0). 

Search
------
Using a smaller dataset, Robertson made an experimental [image-fronted Greek OCR search app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZBZ1IOtFYs). We plan to port this approach to the current site, or assist others in doing something similar.
